# LeetCode-Solutions
Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository.

## Objective
This repository documents my coding journey as I continue to improve my problem-solving skills.  
My goal is to solve the first 300 questions on LeetCode, aiming to solve at least one question per day starting from September 1, 2024.  
Throughout this journey, I will continuously refine my approach, adopting better methods as I progress.  
A new language will be used for the next Epoch if I feel that I've reached a plateau.
